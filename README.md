# redux-saga example

Usually splitting your app state into `pages` feels natural, but sometimes you'll want to have global state for your app. This is an example using `redux` and `redux-saga` that works with universal rendering. This is just one way it can be done. If you have any suggestions or feedback please submit an issue or PR.

> This example and documentation is based on the [with-redux](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/master/examples/with-redux) example.
